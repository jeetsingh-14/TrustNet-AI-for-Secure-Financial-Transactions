# Public Directory Files

This directory contains the static files for the React application.

## Missing Files

The following files are referenced in the application but are not included in this repository:

1. `favicon.ico` - The website icon shown in browser tabs
2. `logo192.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG logo for PWA
3. `logo512.png` - A 512x512 pixel PNG logo for PWA

You can add your own versions of these files to this directory, or you can modify the references in `index.html` and `manifest.json` to remove them.

For a quick start, you can create empty versions of these files or download placeholder images.
